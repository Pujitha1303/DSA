8.Remove Duplicates: Write a program to remove duplicate characters from a string.

9.String Comparison: Compare two strings and determine if they are equal, ignoring the case.

10.Substring Check: Check if a string contains a particular substring.

11.String Reversal without Special Characters: Reverse a string while keeping the position of special characters unchanged.

12.Caesar Cipher: Implement a simple Caesar cipher, which shifts characters in a string by a specified number of positions.
